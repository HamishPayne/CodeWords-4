# WEEK_09

## Main Project
## [Current work in progress](https://TajHealy.github.io/CodeWords/week_09/randomWalker/) 

This weeks lesson was mostly just dedicated to starting off our project and getting as much as we could working in the time we had. I spent my time reading up on p5.js' textToPoints function on the p5.js reference page and watching The Coding Train randomWalk tutorial on youtube so I could start turning my text into shapes that could be manipulated.
