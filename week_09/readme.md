This weekâ€™s lesson was mostly just dedicated to starting off our project and getting as much as we could working in the time we had. I spent my time reading up on p5.js' textToPoints function on the p5.js reference page and watching The Coding Train randomWalk tutorial on YouTube so I could start turning my text into shapes that could be manipulated. 

I was especially stuck after class with creating a carriage return effect with my textToPoints so they wouldn't run off the page. Karen was a huge help and provided me with the code that creates margins and carriage returns which I ended up using as a template.
