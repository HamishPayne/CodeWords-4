## THE BAY

‘The Bay’ is an interactive digital reading experience created using JavaScript. The work is based on Metahaven’s text ‘Blackletter and Black Metal’ which explores the concept behind illegible black metal band logos and relates this illegibility to CAPTCHAS ‘I am not a robot’ text. Metahaven also explores the subcultures surrounding black letter and discusses the use of black metal music being used as a method of torture in Guantanamo bay.  

My work presents a passage from Metahaven’s original text on Guantanamo Bay’s torture methods and appropriates it in order to explore the concept of illegible type in a digital space. This is achieved by forging an experience that forces the reader to endure virtual torture. This sense of torture is generated when the reader begins to scroll, triggering the paragraph of text to begin bleeding. The more the reader scrolls the louder the droning becomes and the heavier the text begins to haemorrhage blood, resulting in the text becoming illegible. This links directly to the methods of torture used by Guantanamo Bay prison and is stylised in a way that aesthetically resembles blackletter and black metal.

The goal of ‘The Bay’ is not simply to explore the concept of illegibility, but to generate interest for Metahaven’s original text and to promote the use of JavaScript as a tool for creating designed digital reading experiences. So many of us almost exclusively read digitally so it’s important we begin designing these experiences and pushing the boundaries of what reading in a digital space can be.
