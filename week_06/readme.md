# Paper Prototyping and Pseudo-code
This week’s lesson started with an introduction to paper prototyping. The goal was to create a prototype of a retro game like Frogger, Pong or Tetris. Paper prototyping is important as it’s a quick and easy way to put your ideas down in front of you in an interactive way. Once you’re making the paper prototype it’s also easy to see which parts of your idea need to be coded and how you would like parts of the creation to behave. We also learnt that adapting a paper prototype and combining it with other ideas is very easy and quickly provides a larger range of possible ideas. We then moved on to another practice called pseudo-code. This is an informal prototype of what you suspect the code for a project would look like or involve.

After class, I took time over the next week to brainstorm ideas for my major project, then created paper prototypes based on these sketches. My selected text for this project is ‘Blackletter and Black Metal’ by Metahaven. My paper prototypes play with the legibility and clarity of my chosen text with different aspects making the text more or less difficult to read.

In this week’s code lesson, we were taught how to incorporate paragraphs of text into our work and how to code random results. I found learning how to create random patterns and select elements from a list at random extremely interesting. I hope to incorporate elements of random in my major project so this session was a step in a direction I would like to follow and understand even better.
