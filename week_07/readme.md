# Major Project
During class this week I decided on a short passage from my chosen text 'Black Letter and Black Metal' by Metahaven that I felt encaptulated the text. At the moment I plan on using this passage in my major project as I feel it would intregue people and make them wonder what the text could possibly be about. The passage is as follows...

"At the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, an American extra-legal bastion located outside of any jurisdiction, prisoners caught in the ‘War on Terror’ were exposed to a range of experimental punitive methods, in order to have them disclose information about their alleged membership to terrorist networks. One of those advanced torture methods consisted of exposing kneeled, chained prisoners to (black) metal music played at concert volume with the same song repeating for hours."

At the moment I feel I could tie this passage into my design through the use of scary audio or visuals suggesting the idea of being tortured.


# Pseudo Code

My current concept is to have the reader land on a page of blackletter text but as they scroll the letters branch out like a metal band logo and audio gets louder. 


``` // 
START

show preloaded text in legible font
    play quiet humming sound

IF user scrolls down
  Type becomes illegible
  sound playing gets louder

ELSE IF user does not scroll
  leave type legible and sound quiet
  
IF user scrolls up
  make type more legible
  make sound quiet

UNLESS user has already scrolled up THEN
  leave type legible
  leave sound quiet 
```

This week in the code corner we were introduced to importing and pre-loading .mp3 files into our sketches. This led into a tutorial on how to generate visuals that react to the volume of the sounds playing. We were then all tasked with creating and uploading our own remixes of what we learnt in class. Using code to generate visuals based on sound is very interesting to me and I can imagine implimenting something like this into my major project.
