# WEEK_07

## Major Project
During class this week I decided on a short passage from my chosen text Black 'Letter and Black Metal' by Metahaven that I felt encaptulated the text. At the moment I plan on using this passage in my major project as I feel it would intregue people and make them wonder what the text could possibly be about. The passage is as follows...

"At the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, an American extra-legal bastion located outside of any jurisdiction, prisoners caught in the ‘War on Terror’ were exposed to a range of experimental punitive methods, in order to have them disclose information about their alleged membership to terrorist networks. One of those advanced torture methods consisted of exposing kneeled, chained prisoners to (black) metal music played at concert volume with the same song repeating for hours."

At the moment I feel I could tie this passage into my design through the use of blaring audio.
