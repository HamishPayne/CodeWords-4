# WEEK_02

## Modular Typography
We began our week 2 lesson by exploring modular type and gathering examples we found interesting and sharing them via a google doc. I learnt that modular typography was an alphabet conforming to rules like only using certain shapes or being restricted to a kind of grid. These restrictions is what connects modular typography to the use of type in coding.
