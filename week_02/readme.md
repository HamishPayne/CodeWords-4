# WEEK_02

## Modular Typography
We began our week 2 lesson by exploring modular type and gathering examples we found interesting and sharing them via a google doc. I learnt that modular typography was an alphabet conforming to rules like only using certain shapes or being restricted to a kind of grid. These restrictions is what connects modular typography to the use of type in coding. 

## 'Second Life' and 'The House of Leaves'
This week we were also introduced to ‘House of Leaves’ and broke up into groups based on the games we hoped to use as a vehicle to reinterpret the text in the form of a digital video. The reason I wanted to work in Second Life (SL) was because I had seen YouTube videos of people interacting with die hard SL players who took the role-playing side of the game very seriously. I found these interactions funny and thought it was extremely interesting that people had taken to this game in such a way. My group used our time in class to download the game and introduce ourselves to one another. Some challenges we expected to encounter while reinterpreting the book into a digital world was the trade of written explanations for quick visuals that encapsulate what the text is trying to explain. We also began to discuss possible passages to cut or combine to stay within the assignments time limit.
