# WEEK_01

## Hello + Welcome
For our first class we began with a quick introduction to the course ‘Codewords = Code + Words’ and held a short discussion on Andy and Karen ann’s history of work and why would should (or should not) trust them. This gave as a clear understanding on some of the basic learning goals in the course and what we can expect to achieve.


## Minecraft Melbourne + Hyper-textuality

MINECRAFT MELBOURNE + HYPERTEXTUALITY
At midday the class gathered in a Minecraft version of Melbourne. It was interesting to see people interacting and co-operating in a digital space as if it were a physical classroom. During this we discussed hyper-textuality and how reading will change in the digital world. This experience made me wonder how virtual environments could replace physical classrooms in an unusual time such as now. 

(The following is a train of thought I had considering the possibility of a digital classroom...)
At the moment I feel the only way a virtual classroom could adequately replace a physical one would be if the virtual space offered seamless cooperation between peers and the opportunity for individuals to be distracted. While distractions aren’t necessarily seen as good, I feel as if it’s necessary to have the opportunity for human flaws in a digital space to prevent it from being dull or too constrictive. I feel digital classrooms at the moment don’t provide humanistic nuances and the shifting of focus that naturally occurs in the real world, rendering it to feel forced and droning (this is at the fault of the programs, not any lecturere).

## An Introduction to CODE
In our first coding lesson we learnt the basics of opening up Processing and setting up a new sketch under p5.Js mode. We also gained an understanding of how to draw different colours, shapes, lines and ways to make the code interactive. Before next class we were asked to use this new knowledge to create the first letter of our first name.
