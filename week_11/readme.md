# WEEK_11

## Major Project
## [Try out the experience!](https://TajHealy.github.io/CodeWords/week_11/tinkeredWeek11/)

This week I made a huge amount of progress by tweaking and refining my code so it operated and appeared the way I wanted aesthetically. In the beggining of this majot project I wanted the end product to create the look of a black metal band logo, becoming illegible as you scrolled. This was to create a link between black metal and the communication of torture via black metal music. Despite this, over the past week I began to realise and form much deeper connections than I initially inteded resulting in a product that may not directly represent my initial idea but improves upon it. 

My new creation creates a simulation or experience where the users movement (whether it be mouseMove, mousePressed or mouseWheel) results in the size of the dripping points increasing. This creates a sense of panic as the more the user attempts to read and scroll the more they are punished, creating a bleeding effect running down the page. This disturbing bleeding effect links directly to torture and the punishment victims of torture face when they resist or move. The addition of a droning sound also links to the texts discussion of torture via sound and adds to the sense of pannic while trying to read. While it's almost impossible to read the entire passage without bleeding over the text, I believe this will generate enough interest that viewers will want to see the source of the original reading.
