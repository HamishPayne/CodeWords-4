# WEEK_10

# MAJOR PROJECT: Progress so far
## [The start of my major project](https://TajHealy.github.io/CodeWords/week_10/simpleShapePara/) 
This week I focussed on applying a carriage return to my text to points and applying my random walk function to the points on each letter. This was achieved with great help from Karen who was able to point out what was preventing my current code from not running the wat I expected. At the moment I'm mostly focussed on making sure my formatting and typesetting is the way I want.

## Iterations and tweaking
These images demonstrate some of the tweaks I made while playing around with how the random walk class skews and at what rate and size. I found the flame effect from skewing the points upward and the natural bacteria-like effect of not skewing the points in any direction especially interesting.
