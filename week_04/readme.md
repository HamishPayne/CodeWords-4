# WEEK_04

# CODE CORNER
This week we focussed on how to pre-load and load different typefaces into our Code, then animate them to repeat, fade and spin. This was a fun first step to gaining an understanding of how we can start to incorporate written information into our coding.

# Group Assignment
Before our next class my group and I began re-recording scenes as we felt our first round of footage was not as carefully planned as we would've liked. In the end, re-recording was a great decision as we were able to more carefully plan out which locations and dialogue we wanted to include and location scout environments we felt better suited the story. One reason we scouted new locations was because our first house was located on an island called ‘Temptations Adult Resort’ and was categorised as ‘Adult’.  Eventually we were banned from the island as the people running the server felt we weren’t taking the sex themes of the island seriously enough. After another session of recording and finding synthesised voices for each character here https://tetyys.com/SAPI4/ we were able to edit and compile our footage and upload it onto YouTube.
