# WEEK_12

# Major Project
After class in week 11 I began refining and tidying my code in preperation for our final submission at the end of the week. I also continued to work on getting the code working on different sized computer and mobile displays to ensure everyone that wanted to try out the code could. Karen was a huge help in making this possible for me guiding me through how to use p5.js map() function. Most issues I ran into had to do with how I was organising with my code but by the beginning of the week I had a finished product I was happy to present.
