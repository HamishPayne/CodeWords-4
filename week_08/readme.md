# WEEK_08

## Major Project
This week was mainly dedicated to breaking down and understanding individual elements of code that I would have to learn in order to be able to make my project a reality. To achieve a randomised "metal" style logo, I learnt how to create a Random Walk function. This is when you tell a point on your canvas to randomly shift up, down, left or right by the amount (pixels) you set. You are also able to skew the likeliness of which direction it will move each frame. I also learnt how to use the mouse wheel function to scroll up and down the canvas and trialled different text layouts on the page. I have started looking into how to create frequencies using p5.sound and the p5.Oscillator function. 

At the moment I think the most difficult part of this project will be learning how to make mouseWheel down interact with the sound and random walk as well as applying a tapering random walk effect to text.

## CODE CORNER
This weekâ€™s coding lesson in class walked us through a huge range of JavaScript possibilities including creating classes, new variables like rand, letter and speed, how to create a wriggling effect and how to assign the variables and application of these wriggles to mousePressed and mouseX, mouseY.
