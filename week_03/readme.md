We began our week 3 class with a brief introduction to digital avatars and virtual identities. I quickly drew a connection between what we were discussing, and the personas I had seen people creating in Second Life. While the idea of a virtual identity seemed foreign at first, I soon realised people now a days (including me) create and communicate through virtual accounts more often than they realise. I believe even this GitHub is in some way just a virtual identity or segment of myself I’ve created online in order to showcase and log my progress through this course.

# AI Dungeon + Electronic Literature

This week we were also introduced to a website called AI dungeon which is a free-to-play text adventure game that uses AI to create an infinite amount of possibilities and responses. A large amount of the class began a horror scenario with each of us being able to play different characters in the story. Eventually the story devolved into an infinite loop of the world being destroyed and recreated at which point we had to unfortunately stop playing. This led us into a discussion on Electronic Literature during which we collected examples of the different kinds of E-Lit. These categories included Chatbots, live coding, generative texts, words appearing / disappearing, spinning / rotating, growing, animated words, motion type and generative novels. This was a great way to see all the different ways modern coding could be combined with literature.

For our first assignment, my group took this week to focus on location scouting and finding ways we could use environments in Second Life to clearly communicate visuals from the novel ‘House of Leaves’.
