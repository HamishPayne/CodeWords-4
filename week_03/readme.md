# WEEK_03

# Avatars and Virtual identities  
We began our week 3 class with a brief introduction to digital avatars and virtual identities. I quickly drew a connection between what we were discussing, and the personas I had seen people creating in Second Life. While the idea of a virtual identity seemed foreign at first, I soon realised people now a days (including me) create and communicate through virtual accounts more often than they realise. I believe even this GitHub is in some way just a virtual identity or segment of myself Iâ€™ve created online in order to showcase and log my progress through this course.
