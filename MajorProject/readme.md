# Designer Statement
‘The Bay’ is an interactive reading experience created using JavaScript. The work is inspired by Metahaven’s text ‘Blackletter and Black Metal’ which explores illegible black metal logos and relates this illegibility to CAPTCHAS ‘I am not a robot’. Metahaven also explores the subcultures surrounding black metal and the use of black metal music being used as a method of torture in Guantanamo bay.

‘The Bay’ appropriates a passage from Metahaven’s original text on Guantanamo Bay’s torture methods while exploring the concept of illegible type. This is achieved by forcing the reader to endure virtual torture. This simulation begins when the reader begins to scroll, triggering the text to begin bleeding. The more the reader scrolls the louder the droning sound becomes and the heavier the text haemorrhages blood, resulting in illegible text. This links directly to the methods of torture used by Guantanamo Bay prison and is stylised in a way that aesthetically resembles blackletter and black metal.

The goal of ‘The Bay’ is not simply to explore illegibility, but to generate interest for Metahaven’s original text and the use of JavaScript as a tool for creating designed reading experiences. We almost exclusively read digitally so it’s important we begin designing these experiences and pushing the boundaries of what reading online can be.
